## ⚠️ Minor Issues (Non-Critical)

### 🔌 API Authentication
- **Issue**: API endpoint returns 401 (Unauthorized) - expected behavior
- **Impact**: Low - API requires authentication by design
- **Recommendation**: Configure API authentication tokens for testing

---

## ❌ Issues Requiring Attention

### 1. 🔐 Instructor/Student Login Issues
- **Problem**: Django Axes security middleware interfering with test authentication
- **Impact**: Medium - affects automated testing but not real user login
- **Solution**: Configure Axes properly or disable for testing environments

### 2. 📊 Admin Dashboard Missing
- **Problem**: `/admin/dashboard/` returns 404
- **Impact**: Low - Django admin at `/admin/` likely works fine
- **Solution**: Create admin dashboard view or update URL pattern

### 3. 🚦 Course Page Redirects
- **Problem**: Course list and detail pages return 302 (redirects)
- **Impact**: Low - indicates proper permission-based redirects
- **Solution**: Verify authentication requirements for course access

   AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
       'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
       # 'axes.backends.AxesStandaloneBackend',  # Comment out for testing
   ]
   ```

2. **Create Admin Dashboard**:
   ```python
   # Add to core/views.py
   @login_required
   @user_passes_test(lambda u: u.role == 'admin')
   def admin_dashboard_view(request):
       # Admin dashboard implementation
       pass
   ```

### 🔧 Short-term Improvements (Medium Priority)
1. **Enhance Testing**: Add more comprehensive unit tests
2. **API Documentation**: Complete API documentation with examples
3. **Mobile App**: Consider React Native mobile companion
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Implement learning analytics dashboard

### 🌟 Long-term Enhancements (Low Priority)
1. **Microservices**: Consider breaking into microservices for scale
